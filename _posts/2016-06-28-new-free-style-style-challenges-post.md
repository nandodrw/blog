So here I’m. I’m 28 years old web developer, I’ve coded for some years now (I used to be a risk consultant in the past, but that is other story). I had a startup dream, but  I saw how it broke into pieces, like many people. I started coding at the very beginning in the JavaScript boom. At that time, you couldn’t imagine being indifferent to JavaScript, you had to love it or you had to hate it. In summary, my life as a coder has been pretty exciting, rushed and opinionated driving around the tech’s metropoli (opinionated because everybody has it own strong point, of view on each imaginable topic).

A big part of this trip I did it in the USA, specifically on Austin Texas. Austin is a great place to be, especially for tech people. During that time I met many cool and skillful people. Those guys helped me to understand that, these five things compose the path to mastery: tough challenges, a competitive environment, economical sustainability, motivation and hard work. Because these 5 things the road to follow became obvious: top tier freelancing. Let me explain why.

When I had to come back to my lovely country (no sarcasm, Peru is a precious jewel in Latin America), I quickly noticed the differences between the tech industries (compared to the USA). Even when everybody is doing a great effort to develop the industry in my country, it’s still being a long path to walk. So, in order to be a productive and valuable member of this tech community (this is my main motivation), I first need to find a way to stay updated on technology (here is where the tough challenges and a competitive environment come). Is important to make a proper living (economical sustainability, since Peru’s main industry is not tech, payments rates stay relative low). The last ingredient, the hard work is a consequence of motivation and a competitive environment. In order to get all these things together my best option is top tier remote freelancing.

Since was pretty clear that the answer is freelancing, the next question was: How I can do it? After lot of research, the answer became obvious: [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/).

After researching other freelancing platforms, was easy to notice that many of them base their business on quantity, instead of quality. In most of them, people just can sign up and start applying to jobs. These are great opportunities for entry-level developers, or for somebody who is looking for a quick job but It doesn’t seem ideal for long-term engagements. Something I learned during my consultant time is: when employers identify a labor supplier as massive and low quality, it’s pretty hard to change that perception. In other words, get involved in other freelancing platforms, put yourself in a situation where you are only identified as affordable hands, for ground code job. That is a position where I don’t want to be.

But, how am I sure Toptal is an curated and high quality freelancing platform? Easy. First; the entry process. The admission process is well known to be highly challenging, like any other top tech company. Second; the clients, the best clients pick the best that they can pay for. Toptal has big names on their client’s records, like Airbnb, J.P. Morgan, Zendesk, just to mention some of them. Finally; Toptal’s blog posts. Toptal has published really [great blog posts](https://www.toptal.com/blog) about technology and design. Actual freelancers who work there have written the Toptal’s blog posts. The publications are always rich on technical content and relevant; I would love to be on the same boat with such knowledgeable people.

This is why I’m choosing freelancing with Toptal. I’m feeling I’m starting a new exciting journey. There are going to be many challenges to tackle, many things to learn and hard work to do, but that is what makes it fun. Wish me luck!
