So here I'm, I'm 28 years old web developer, I've coded for some years now (I used to be a risk consultant in the past, but that is other story). I had my startup dream, I also saw my startup dream broke into pieces (like many people). I started coding at the very beginning of the JavaScript boom, at that time you couldn't remain indiferent with JavaScript, you had to loved it or you had to hated it. In summary my life as coder has been a pretty exciting, rushed and opinionated driving around the tech's metropoli  (opinionated becouse everybody has it own strong point, of view on each imaginable topic).

A big part of this trip I did it on USA, specificaly on Austin Texas. Austin is a great place to be, especialy for tech people. During that time IÂ´ve been meeting a lot of cool and skillful guys and girls. Those people helped me to understand that, the path to mastery is composed by these five things: tough challenges, a competitive enviroment, economical sustainability, motivation and hard work. Is because these 5 things the road to follow became obvious: top tier freelancing. Let me explain why.

When I had to back to my lovely country (no sarcasm, Peru is precious jewel in Latin America), I quickly noticed the diferences between the tech industries, in Peru and USA. Even when everybody is doing a great effort to develop the industry, still be a long path to walk. So, in order to be a productive and valuable member of this tech comunity (this is my motivation), I first need to find a way to stay updated on technology (here is where the tough challenges and a competitive enviroment came). Is important to a make a proper living (economical sustainability, since Peru's main industry is not tech, payments rates stay relative low). The last ingredient, the hard work is a consequence of motivation and a competitive enviroment. In order to get all these things together, I could go somewhere else to work (this will mean lose the opportunity to collaborate with the peruvian's tech comunity), or I can do top tier remote freelancing.

Since was pretty clear that the answer is freelancing, the next question was: How I can do it? After lot of research, the answer became obvious: [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/).

After research other freelancing platforms, was easy to noticed that many of them base their business on quantity, instead of quality. In most of them, people just can sign up and start applying to jobs. These are great opportunities for entry level developers, or for somebody who is looking for a quick job. It doesn't seem ideal for long term engagements. Something I learned during my consultant time is: when employers identify a labor supplier as massive and low quality, it's pretty hard to change that perception. In other words, get involve in other freelancing platforms, is put yourself in a situation where you are identified as affordable hands, for ground code job. That is a position where I dont want to be.

But, how am I sure Toptal is a curated and high quality freelancing platform? Easy, first of all the entry process. The adminsion process is well know to be higly challenging, like any other top tech company. Second, the clients, the best clients pick the best the can pay for. Toptal has big names on their client's records, like Airbnb, J.P. Morgan, Zendesk, just to mention some of them. Finally, Toptal's blog posts. Toptal has published really [great blog posts](https://www.toptal.com/blog) about technology and design. The Toptal's blog posts have been written by actual freelancers who work there. The publications are always rich on technical content and relevant; I would love to be on the same boat with such knowledgeable people.

This is how and why I'm choosing freelancing with Toptal. I'm feeling I'm starting a new exciting journey. There are going to be many challenges to tackle, many things to learn and hard work to do, but that is what makes it fun. Wish me luck!
