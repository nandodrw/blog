title: The Developer Path to Design/Art Mastery
---

If you are one of those coders who has been frequently amazed by stunning websites, eye catching 3D animations that render without plug-ins, or yet even more mysterious, the minimalistic blogs that only use different font sizes and weights to create a nice reading experiences, you have been captured by the fine art and elusive tricks of design.

In case you are unhappy with being just a content consumer, and you want to generate high quality visual content, you need to start learning design and maybe a little art.

 >Note: design and art are related or, besides that, one is part of the other.

Why learning design as developer could be frustrating?
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

They are many reasons why you could feel frustrated or overwhelmed during the design learning journey. Some of them are:

* Our first attempts could result in not that satisfying results.
* We know/feel some particular design is not good enough, but we don't know why is that.
* Could be challenging to define a study path to follow in order to sharp your design skills.
* They are so many resources (from websites, books to schools) that could be hard to pick.
* Sometimes you can feel that so much trouble to learn design is not worth it as a developer
