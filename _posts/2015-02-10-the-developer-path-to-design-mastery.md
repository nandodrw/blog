title: The Developer Path to Design/Art Mastery
---

If you are one of those coders who is frequently amazed by stunning websites, eye catching 3D animations that render without plug-ins, or minimalistic blogs that use only font sizes and weights to create nice reading experiences, you have been captured by the fine art and elusive tricks of design.

<!-- In case you are unhappy with being just a content consumer, and you want to generate high quality visual content, you need to start learning design--and maybe a little art. -->

If you want to produce beautiful front-end visuals, you are going to need to learn design.

<!-- >Design and art are related or, besides that, one is part of the other. -->

## Why might learning design as a developer be frustrating?

They are many reasons why you might feel frustrated or overwhelmed during the design learning journey. Some of them are:

* The results of your first attempts can be unsatisfactory for you.
* You usually know or feel that some particular design is not good, but, most of the time, you don't know why.
* Could be challenging to define a study path to follow.
* There are so many learning resources (from websites, to books, to schools) that it can be difficult to pick what to follow.

## Why shouldn't it be frustrating?

Fortunately there are also reasons why this journey should be joyful. Every person should find their own balance to enjoy learning design, but as an example here are some reasons:

*   YOU WANT TO LEARN, this is a huge thing, not kidding. Having the intention of doing something usually is the beginning of something.
*   You already have the developer skills, now the thing is to figure out how to use those skills in a artistic/stylish/creative/effective(in terms of communication) way.
*   We live in an era when it is really easy to get access to effective learning resources; you just need to pick wisely.
*   Depending on your current occupation/knowledge (as a developer), learning design can improve results at your current job.
*   If you are planing to start a side project or startup, these new skills could be key success factors of your venture.
*   In case you are planning to change jobs or move to a more design oriented department in your current company, you can add your design practice exercises as part of your portfolio.

## How to start

First of all, you need the correct mindset. If you find some somebody's else extraordinary work, instead of feeling discouraged, you should feel excited and motivated and, when possible, try to imitate it. You should discipline yourself so that any time you find a piece of design you liked you'll study it. Another important success factor is to understand that learning will take time, which means that the quality of your job will go up little by little.
